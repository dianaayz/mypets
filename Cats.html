<p>Naveen also goes by "Bebo" is my second youngest cat. I got him in mid november of 2021 in which i begged my mom if we could keep him. Naveen was actually born in a trash can in which my friends cat had them. This actual stuck with him and loves sleeping in tiny trash cans. Naveen is the most sweetest cat, he cant meow correctly and when he does is because he wants something,surprisingly he communicates very well. He hates meeting new strangers and he loves those kitties snacks. Theres been multiple incidents in which he has broken into the snack cabinets and broke the box to get them. Hes the nicest cat but can be kinda annoying when he steals your pillows at night or meows very loud while your sleeping. We named him after Prince Naveen from Princess and the Frog and his nickname "Bebo" from being such a big baby in spanish.</p>

<p>Choco is my youngest cat, we got him during december. He was actually a rescued cat. When we took him in he was very sick and we thought he wasnt gonna smake it. But soon enough he got better with all the medicine we gave him. He's a very shy boy and doesnt like being around a lot of people. He likes to human food a lot but we are still trying to get him used to actual cat food so he wont get sick. He's a very defensice cat and will run away from you if you try picking him up. Even though all that, he's also one of the sweetest boy. He loves attention and getting pet when he wants too. He's very confusing at times but is understandable he likes being around the people who took care of him. He brings home gifts, which we sometimes not accept becasuse its some kind of dead animal. Hes a sweet boy who loves attention from those he likes to be around of. His name was given after my sister liking Chocolate Krispies Cereal when she took him home and the first thing she saw was that.</p>

<p>Malvina Mabel is my second oldest cat, she also goes by "Vina" just for a short name. Shes a very quiet cat but really mean too. Shes actually Naveen's Aunt. They didnt grow up together since their from different litters. She loves hanging out next to the windows and loves being outside too. She can be really mean if you dont feed her on schedule and she will even try tripping you if your around her bowls or even next to her. She can be nice at time too, It really all depends on what time you feed her and if your on schedule on time. She will meow at you as loud as she can to catch your attention. She's very big and fluffy. She also likes human company, shes not shy but she really loves attention from anyone.</p>

<h3>Blue</h3>

<p>Blue is the oldest cat I have. She was named after the color which is very obvious. My little sister didnt know any other words and there was actually another cat named pink but he sadly passed away. She's Vina's Mom and Naveen's grandma. She's very mean to anyone and also very loud. She doesn't like people touching her or even being around her. If you were to pass by her she will scratch you or try to bite you. She might be very mean but theres times when she knows you need comfort so she just sits by you. She hates when other people eat from her bowl if she see's anyone touch it you either need to wash it out or refill it with new food. She just doesnt like anyone touching her stuff including the cat litter. She will not use it if someone else does. Thats why she has her seperate stuff.</p>

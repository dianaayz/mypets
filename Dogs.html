    <p>Baby is one of my dogs shes almost 4 years old, and she's the most precious dog ever. Shes a mixed pug with poodle. Shes very energetic but lazy. She likes staring at you if your eating something and then she will sit there till you give her some. She likes sleeping under the blankets and she likes to sleep directly next to your legs. If not she will bite the blanket till you let her sleep there. I got her after I got really depressed and she helped a lot. Shes the dog that I really appreaciate having even though she can be a little annoying sometimes. We named her Baby after my little sister wanted a baby toy and it just stuck with her.</p>
    <h3>Nani</h3>

    <p>Nani is the youngest dog we have right now. Shes really funny and energetic, Shes baby's kid. She isnt ACTUALLY ours since its my older brothers but we are just babysitting her for a while. Shes really cute when she can be but sometimes she will just get on your nerves. Theres been multiple incidents in which she has ran out the door and made us  chase her down the street. It can be very annoying and hard to deal with. But we still love her. Shes also really easily scared she doesnt really pay attention. And just like her mom she likes sleeping under the blankets and on your legs. It just some weird thing they got. Shes also a pug in a way its like 80% pug and 20% poodle. Since her dad is a full pug.

    <p>Max is one of my oldest dogs. If I remember correctly we got him when i was 9. So its been maybe like 6 years already. Hes really old and blind. Hes also very overprotective of my mom and us. Hes a really nice dog and helps a lot. We try to not change the house a lot because he will bump into stuff. Hes also very loud and doesnt like when other people come to the house. Hes always well alerted and basically a guard dog. Hes a poodle and also is baby's dad. </p>
